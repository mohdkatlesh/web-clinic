# Chest X-Ray Diagnosis using Deep Learning

### AI and machine learning have gained a lot of popularity and acceptance in recent years. With the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the situation changed even more. During the crisis, we witnessed a rapid digital transformation and the adoption of disruptive technology across different industries. Healthcare was one of the potential sectors that gained many benefits from deploying disruptive technologies. AI, machine learning, and deep learning have become an imperative part of the sector. Deep learning in healthcare has a huge impact and it has enabled the sector to improve patient monitoring and diagnostics. Here are the top pathbreaking applications of deep learning in healthcare.




### Chest X-ray exams are one of the most frequent and cost-effective medical imaging examinations available. However, clinical diagnosis of a chest X-rays can be challenging and sometimes more difficult than diagnosis via chest CT imaging. 




## The Dataset 
### This NIH  Chest X-ray Dataset [paper](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-clinical-center-provides-one-largest-publicly-available-chest-x-ray-datasets-scientific-community) is comprised of 112,120 X-ray images with disease labels from 30,805 unique patients. To create these labels.



## Pre-processing the Dataset 
#### The dataset was a row of data and we need to organize the data before feeding it into the model:

## Creating the Deep Learning Models
### The model was created based on the Convolution neural network) CNN by using the Residual Network.

## The source code for creating the model on Kaggle: [Chest X-Ray Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mohammadkatlish/chest-x-ray-image)

# The Web Application and The Services we Provide 
## We could not able to upload it to a live web server because of the size of the models
- Chest X-Ray diagnosis for the 14 labels in the Chest finding.
- Covid-19 X-Ray image diagnosis.
- Online Consulting

# Chest & Covid X-Ray Diagnosis 
### In these services the user can upload the x-ray image and the model can predict the finding in the image based on the data that feed to in the training;
### In the two services the sane strategy we can see:
## uploading the image

## Start the model to predict the status of the x-ray image
### Fot Chest X-ray

### For Covid-19 state

# Online Consulting 
### After the user diagnose the condition, if he needs to consult a doctor for the condition or the state, he just needs to fill a form with the information and email or phone number

### the data will be sent to the doctor by email and he will response as soon as possible.
