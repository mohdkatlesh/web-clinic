# Chest X-Ray Diagnosis using Deep Learning

#### AI and machine learning have gained a lot of popularity and acceptance in recent years. With the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the situation changed even more. During the crisis, we witnessed a rapid digital transformation and the adoption of disruptive technology across different industries. Healthcare was one of the potential sectors that gained many benefits from deploying disruptive technologies. AI, machine learning, and deep learning have become an imperative part of the sector. Deep learning in healthcare has a huge impact and it has enabled the sector to improve patient monitoring and diagnostics. Here are the top pathbreaking applications of deep learning in healthcare.

#### Chest X-ray exams are one of the most frequent and cost-effective medical imaging examinations available. However, clinical diagnosis of a chest X-rays can be challenging and sometimes more difficult than diagnosis via chest CT imaging. 

## The Dataset 
#### This NIH  Chest X-ray Dataset [paper](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-clinical-center-provides-one-largest-publicly-available-chest-x-ray-datasets-scientific-community) is comprised of 112,120 X-ray images with disease labels from 30,805 unique patients. To create these labels.

## Pre-processing the Dataset 
#### The dataset was a row data and we need to organize the data before feed it into the model:
